## This is a ...

_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply._

- [ ] fix related to a business issue
- [ ] fix related to a technical issue
- [ ] business feature
- [ ] technical feature
- [ ] part of a feature, which should be merged for collaboration reasons

## Further comments

_If this is a relatively large or complex or important change, kick off the discussion by explaining why you chose the solution you did and what alternatives you considered, etc..._

## Review checklist (DoD)

_These checklist is for code review, in order to validate the MR compliance to the "Definition of Done"._

_The feature team technical leader will put an `x` in the boxes that apply after verifying its compliance._

_After a first review (which could be done alongside with you), if any of its isn't compliant, the feature team technical leader
will put an `-` in all the boxes that apply, put a `[WIP]` in this MR title, and reassign it to you. You'll have to fix **all** of its,
remove the `-` from the boxes, remove the `[WIP]` in the title, and reassign the MR to the feature team technical leader,
which will then review in details your code in order to permit to "check" the last box._

_This process should only occur once in most cases._

### Tests

- [ ] new code has a unit tests coverage of 80% or more

### Documentation

- [ ] each modification or addition that isn't private is well documented in javadoc format
- [ ] each mocked data is preceded by a generic currency sign ( `Â¤` )
